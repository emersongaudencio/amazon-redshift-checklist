## How to use

All items in the **Amazon Redshift Checklist** are required for the majority of the projects, but some elements can be omitted or are not essential. We choose to use 3 levels of flexibility:

- :o: means that the item is **recommended** but can be omitted in some particular situations.
- :interrobang: means that the item is **highly recommended** and can eventually be omitted in some really particular cases.
- :bangbang: means that the item **can't be omitted** by any reason.

Some resources possess an emoticon to help you understand which type of content / help you may find on the checklist:

- :book: documentation or article
- :wrench: online tool / testing tool
- :video_camera: media or video content

## Designing Tables

- [ ] :bangbang: **Table distribution styles:** In order to utilise the parallel nature of Redshift, data must be correctly distributed within each table of the cluster.

  - :book: [Choosing a data distribution style](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/redshift/latest/dg/t_Distributing_data.html)

- [ ] :interrobang: **Column compression:** Ensures data is better compressed utilising less storage space.

  - :book: [Choosing a column compression type](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/redshift/latest/dg/t_Compressing_data_on_disk.html)

- [ ] :interrobang: **Table sort keys:** Ensures data is retrieved from within each node in the most performant way.

  - :book: [Choosing sort keys](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/redshift/latest/dg/t_Sorting_data.html)

- [ ] :o: **Table constraints:** Not enforced by Redshift but helps query optimisers.

  - :book: [Defining constraints](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/redshift/latest/dg/t_Defining_constraints.html)

## Loading Data

- [ ] :bangbang: **COPY command:** Load files from S3 to Redshift via COPY to ensure parallel quick loads.

  - :book: [Use a COPY command to load data](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/redshift/latest/dg/c_best-practices-use-copy.html)

- [ ] :interrobang: **Compress data files:** Use either GZIP, LZOP, BZIP2, or ZSTD.

  - :book: [Compress your data files](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/redshift/latest/dg/c_best-practices-compress-data-files.html)

- [ ] :interrobang: **Multi-row insert:** If a COPY command is not an option and you require SQL inserts, use a multi-row insert whenever possible.

  - :book: [Use a multi-row insert](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/redshift/latest/dg/c_best-practices-multi-row-inserts.html)

- [ ] :interrobang: **Sort key order:** Load your data in sort key order to avoid needing to vacuum.

  - :book: [Load data in sort key order](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/redshift/latest/dg/c_best-practices-sort-key-order.html)

- [ ] :interrobang: **Automatic compression:** Use the COPY command with `COMPUPDATE` set to ON to automatically set column encoding for brand new tables

  - :book: [Loading tables with automatic compression](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/redshift/latest/dg/c_Loading_tables_auto_compress.html)

- [ ] :o: **Split data into multiple files:** Split your load data files so that the files are about equal size, between 1 MB and 1 GB after compression.

  - :book: [Split your load data into multiple files](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/redshift/latest/dg/c_best-practices-use-multiple-files.html)

- [ ] :o: **Automatic compression:** Use the COPY command with COMPUPDATE set to ON. Note this will impact performance and should only be used on the first load.

  - :book: [ANALYZE COMPRESSION](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/redshift/latest/dg/r_ANALYZE_COMPRESSION.html)

- [ ] :o: **Analyse query performance:** `STL_ALERT_EVENT_LOG` table allows users to analyse and improve performance issues.

## Security

- [ ] :bangbang: **Enhanced VPC routing:** Forces all COPY and UNLOAD traffic between your cluster and your data repositories through your Amazon VPC.

  - :book: [Amazon Redshift enhanced VPC routing](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/redshift/latest/mgmt/enhanced-vpc-routing.html)

- [ ] :bangbang: **User groups:** Create different user groups and grant privileges based on their roles.

  - :book: [Example for controlling user and group access](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/redshift/latest/dg/t_user_group_examples.html)

- [ ] :interrobang: **:new: Federated user access:** Consider providing user access via SAML-2.0 using AD FS, PingFederate, Okta, or Azure AD.

## Cluster

- [ ] :bangbang: **:new: RA3 nodes** Consider using Redshift's new RA3 nodes with a mix of local cache and S3 backed elastic storage if compute requirements exceed dense compute or dense storage node levels.

  - :book: [Amazon Redshift introduces RA3 nodes with managed storage enabling independent compute and storage scaling](https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/whats-new/2019/12/amazon-redshift-announces-ra3-nodes-managed-storage/)

- [ ] :bangbang: **Automated snapshot retention:** The default retention period of 1 day can catch organisations out in case of disaster recovery or rollback. Conside changing to 35 days.

  - :book: [ModifySnapshotCopyRetentionPeriod](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/redshift/latest/APIReference/API_ModifySnapshotCopyRetentionPeriod.html)

- [ ] :o: **Redshift Spectrum:** Consider Redshift Spectrum allows users to query data straight from S3 using a Redshift cluster. This can be used in replacement of a staging schema whereby your stage data lives within your data lake and is ready into Redshift via Spectrum

  - :book: [Getting started with Amazon Redshift Spectrum](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/redshift/latest/dg/c-getting-started-using-spectrum.html)
  - :book: [Why youâ€™re better off exporting your data to Redshift Spectrum, instead of Redshift](https://mixpanel.com/blog/why-youre-better-off-exporting-your-data-to-redshift-spectrum-instead-of-redshift/)

- [ ] :o: **:new: Pause and resume:** Redshift has recently introduced the ability to pause and resume the cluster within minutes.

  - :book: [Pausing and resuming clusters](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/redshift/latest/mgmt/managing-cluster-operations.html#rs-mgmt-pause-resume-cluster)
  - :wrench: [Redshift Smart Pause and Resume](https://github.com/servian/aws-redshift-smart-pause-and-resume)

- [ ] :o: **:new: Elastic resize:** Consider using elastic resize over classic resize when changing both the node types and number of nodes within your Redshift cluster. Elastic resize is much quicker (minutes vs hours) and doesn't take your cluster out of commision.

  - :book: [Amazon Redshift now supports changing node types within minutes with elastic resize](https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/whats-new/2020/04/amazon-redshift-now-supports-changing-node-types-within-minutes-with-elastic-resize/)
